## Maintainer Wanted

See [here](https://github.com/tobias/vertx-swift-eventbus/issues/11).

This provides a Swift client for talking to [Vert.x](http://vertx.io)
via the
[vertx-tcp-eventbus-bridge](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-tcp-eventbus-bridge).

It has only been tested with [Swift 3.1](https://swift.org/download/)
on MacOS X and Ubuntu.

A simple example application is available in [example-project](https://github.com/tobias/vertx-swift-eventbus/tree/master/example-project).

The API docs are available at http://tobias.github.io/vertx-swift-eventbus/.

## Usage

The latest release is `0.2.0`. To use it with Swift Package Manager,
add the following to your dependencies in `Package.swift`:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/tobias/vertx-swift-eventbus.git", "0.2.0")
```

## Running the tests

`make test`

The tests build a Vert.x server and launch it, so you'll need Java (8
or higher) and maven installed.

## Generating docs

To generate documentation, you'll need to have
[`sourcekitten`](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten) and
[`jazzy`](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) installed. The easiest way
to do that (on MacOS) is with:

```
brew install sourcekitten
sudo gem install jazzy
```

Then, build the docs with:

`make docs`

The generated docs will be available in `docs/`.
